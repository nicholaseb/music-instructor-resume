                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I'm a songwriter and member of the band Hiding Places, and we've been doing the DIY thing for the past 5 years. Through this experience, I've learned countless lessons in patience, discipline, musical technique, and collaboration.</p>
                
                <p>I've been playing guitar for 15 years, and for the first 4 years I took lessons weekly and also participated in facilitated bands via the music school I attended in Athens, GA. I also participated in Camp Amped, which is a summer music program for teens to learn how to collaborate with other musicians in bands.</p>
                
                <p>This experience was extremely formative for me, and I gained a lot of confidence in myself through my love for music and the opportunities to put myself out there.</p>
                
                <p>I now teach occasional lessons to friends who are beginners at guitar, and I provide materials during the lesson as well as homework/practice schedules to make sure that we build progress lesson to lesson. I am very interested in making teaching lessons a regular part of my schedule. Teaching is very fulfilling to me, and my own experience taking lessons at the beginning of my journey inspires me to provide that for others.</p>
